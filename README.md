# PLIBMTTBHGATY
## Programming Languages I Have Been Meaning To Try But Haven't Got Around To Yet

Welcome to PLIBMTTBHGATY! This repo is a collection of resources for
participants taking part in a PLIBMTTBHGATY event. If you're reading this,
you're probably at our workshop at [!!Con 2022](https://bangbangcon.com).

### How do you even pronounce that?

> @deniseyu: I just say "plibem...magotty" and pretend the letters in the middle don't exist ðŸ˜‚

> @spike01: plib-muh-tuh-tub-huh-gaty - but the real pronunciation is the
> friends we made along the way

## History

Star Simpson (https://twitter.com/starsandrobots) organized the first PLIBMTTBHGATY about 10 years ago, and events have been run all over the world!

From [the Thoughtbot blog](thoughtbot.com/blog/a-new-look-for-plibmttbhgaty), the event is:

> a lightly-structured party where people get together and work on a project in a new programming language, either with or just near each other.
>  
> This all started with the realization that plenty of people have a side-project in mind to work on, that it's more fun to work together, and that many of us are just waiting for a good excuse to get started.

@deniseyu and @spike01 organised their first PLIBMTTBHGATY in London in 2018,
and are running their first online one at !!Con 2020.
